## Description
**INSTANCE** is a dataset of seismic waveforms data and associated metadata **suited for artificial inelligence analysis applications**. It includes:
* 54,008 earthquakes for a total of 1,159,249 waveforms;
* 132,330 noise waveforms;
* 116 metadata for each waveform providing information on station, trace source, path and quality;
* 19 networks;
* 620 seismic stations.

*Earthquakes a) and stations b) of the dataset. Symbols size are proportional to earthquake magnitude and number of arrival phases recorded by stations, respectively*

The **notebooks** provided in this repo can be used to reproduce the figures of the manuscript Michelini et al., 2021, submitted.

We also distribute a very small size **sample dataset** to run the notebooks provided in the repository. Users potentially interested can evaluate whether **INSTANCE** fulfill their requirements without the cumbersome task of downloading the whole dataset.
